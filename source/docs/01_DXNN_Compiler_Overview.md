This chapter provides an overview of the DEEPX SDK architecture and explains each core component and its role in the AI development workflow.  

## DEEPX SDK Architecture  
![](./../resources/01_SDK_Architecture.drawio_r2.png)

**DEEPX SDK** is an all-in-one software development platform that streamlines the process of compiling, optimizing, simulating, and deploying AI inference applications on DEEPX NPUs (Neural Processing Units). It provides a complete toolchain, from AI model creation to runtime deployment, optimized for edge and embedded systems, enabling developers to build high-performance AI applications with minimal effort.  

**DX-COM** is the compiler in the DEEPX SDK that converts a pre-trained ONNX model and its associated configuration JSON file into a hardware-optimized .dxnn binary for DEEPX NPUs. The ONNX file contains the model structure and weights, while the JSON file defines pre/post-processing settings and compilation parameters. DX-COM provides a fully compiled .dxnn file, optimized for low-latency and high-efficient inference on DEEPX NPU.  

**DX-RT** is the runtime software responsible for executing ,dxnn models on DEEPX NPU hardware. DX-RT directly interacts with the DEEPX NPU through firmware and device drivers, using PCIe interface for high-speed data transfer between the host and the NPU, and provides C/C++ and Python APIs for application-level inference control. DX-RT offers a complete runtime environment, including model loading, I/O buffer management, inference execution, and real-time hardware monitoring.  

**DX ModelZoo** is a curated collection of pre-trained neural network models optimized for DEEPX NPU, designed to simplify AI development for DEEPX users. It includes pre-trained ONNX models, configuration JSON files, and pre-compiled DXNN binaries, allowing developers to rapidly test and deploy applications. DX ModelZoo also provides benchmark tools for comparing the performance of quantized INT8 models on DEEPX NPU with full-precision FP32 models on CPU or GPU.  

**DX-Stream** is a custom GStreamer plugin that enables real-time streaming data integration into AI inference applications on DEEPX NPU. It provides a modular pipeline framework with configurable elements for preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing, tailored to vision AI work. DX-Stream allows developers to build flexible, high-performance applications for use cases such as video analytics, smart cameras, and edge AI systems.  

**DX-APP** is a sample application that demonstrates how to run compiled models on actual DEEPX NPU using DX-RT. It includes ready-to-use code for common vision tasks such as object detection, face recognition, and image classification. DX-APP helps developers quickly set up the runtime environment and serves as a template for building and customizing their own AI applications.
